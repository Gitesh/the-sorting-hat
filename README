Objective
~~~~~~~~~~

Replace a broken sorting hat to sort pupils into 'Gryffindor' and 'Hufflepuff' houses.



Apparatus
~~~~~~~~~

Hardware --> Laptop, Large screen (LDC/Plasma/Projector), Wireless Mouse, Speakers for audio.
Software --> Chrome or Safari (not designed for viewing via Internet Explorer)



Method 
~~~~~~

- Pupils sit on the sorting chair, put on a sorting hat and use the wireless mouse to select their name on the screen.
- As each name is selected, the colour of the childs name is changed from white to their house colour and the house shield is automatically shown.
- Click on the house shield to reset for the next child. The colour of their name will remain changed allowing all present to see:
          a) who still remains to be allocated (white)
          b) which house each pupil has been allocated (Hufflepuff = blue, Gryffindor = gold)
- This process is repeated for each child.



Result
~~~~~~

Pupils are allocated to a house with wild cheers and applause.
