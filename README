Objective: Replace a broken sorting hat to sort pupils into Gryffindor and Hufflepuff Hogwarts houses

Apparatus: Laptop connected, Large screen (LDC/Plasma/Projector), Wireless Mouse, Speakers for audio

Method: Pupils sit on the sorting chair, put on a sorting hat and use the wireless mouse to select their name on the screen.
        As each name is selected, the colour of the childs name is changed from white to their house colour and the house shield is automatically shown.
        Click on the house shield to reset for the next child. The colour of their name will remain changed allowing all present to see:
          - who still remains to be allocated (white)
          - which house each pupil has been allocated (Hufflepuff = blue, Gryffindor = gold)
        This process is repeated for each child.

Result: Pupils are allocated to a house with wild cheers and applause. 

Affirmations: Used sucessfully to sort pupils into houses for a childs 8th birthday party
